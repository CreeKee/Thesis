## Seth Kiefer's Master Thesis
This project is a matrix multiplier architected and implemented by Seth Kiefer as his master's thesis for a master's in Computer Science at Cal Poly, SLO.

The matrix multiplier is designed for implementation on FPGA, and is intended to be used as a hardware accelerator primarily for ANN computations.
